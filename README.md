## Overview
Changing active accounts is done by sending basic commands to the steam client, preventing the process from ending abruptly but automating logout and login.</br>
The application is currently supporting English, Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish</br>
If you switch accounts during the execution of a game, steam will send a command to close the game and immediately afterwards you will be logged in with the other account</br>
The application was not intended to cheat, just automate switching between accounts</br>


## Requisites
It is necessary that [version 9.0.4 or newer of the java runtime environment (JRE)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase9-archive-downloads.html) is installed for the perfect functioning of the application. </br>
It is also necessary that the steam client is installed correctly. </br>
Initially the application is only running on Windows 7 or higher.</br>

## Known Issues
-If you use windows 7, steam can start slowly a few times. It is advisable to give administrative privileges to the steam executable </br>
<b>PS. The executable file (.exe) is being created through Launch4j and that is why some antiviruses like Avast are reporting false positives. I advise that if you want to use the .exe to scan the file so that your antivirus recognizes it as a safe file. Or use the .jar file directly</b>
