# AccountSwitcherBeta
Simple application to switch between accounts, initially, steam. </br>
Changing active accounts is done by sending basic commands to the steam client, preventing the process from ending abruptly but automating logout and login.</br>
It is necessary that version 1.8.0_271 or newer of the java runtime environment (JRE) is installed for the perfect functioning of the application. </br>
It is also necessary that the steam client is installed correctly. </br>
Initially the application is only running on Windows 7 or higher.</br>
