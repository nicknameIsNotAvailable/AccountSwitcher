</br></br>
Changing active accounts is done by sending basic commands to the steam client, preventing the process from ending abruptly but automating logout and login.</br>
It is necessary that version 1.8.0_271 or newer of the java runtime environment (JRE) is installed for the perfect functioning of the application. </br>
It is also necessary that the steam client is installed correctly. </br>
Initially the application is only running on Windows 7 or higher.</br>
PS. If you use windows 7, steam can start slowly a few times. It is advisable to give administrative privileges to the steam executable through a manifest file </br>
<b>PS. The executable file (.exe) is being created through Launch4j and that is why some antiviruses like Avast are reporting false positives. I advise that if you want to use the .exe to scan the file so that your antivirus recognizes it as a safe file. Or use the .jar file directly</b>
